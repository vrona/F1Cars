## F1 CARS CLASSIFICATION - CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORKS

A python application using neural network which classifies 2018 F1 cars / drivers images.

### Abstract

I have gathered F1 car 2018 championship images through the web.
This specific year has been chosen because it marks the begining of an era of new design for open-wheel racing serie: Formula 1.
Regarding the concern of our topic: image recognition and classification, the appearance of the halo (a safety device that protect the driver’s head) has got one consequence, it hides the driver’s helmet and then an opportunity to distinguish F1 car/driver from another.

#### Development in progress based on: Python 3.6 –  Pytorch 0.4 – Ubuntu 16.04 (Linux). Computation made on Paperspace.
